Hello Streamer. Thanks for playing our game.

The theme is "1 HP". We thought about making
the character only have one health, because
that can be fun and fast paced. Unfortunately,
that can lead to playing like a coward, which
isn't fun or fast paced. It's tough.

So we thought, what if your DAMAGE only had 1
HP? That's weird. But we liked the idea, so we
tried it. We hope you have fun playing it!
